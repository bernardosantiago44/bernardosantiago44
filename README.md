- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bernardosantiago44
- ðŸ‘€ I like Data Science.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently developing in SwiftUI
  
  I am an undergraduate student of B.S. in Computer Science and Information Technologies at TecnolÃ³gico de Monterrey.

  I have created 2 mobile applications for iOS using SwiftUI.

  # Elementals
  Elementals is an interactive periodic table for iOS. You can visualize important properties for each of the 119 chemical elements.
  The public repository of this file is available [here](https://github.com/bernardosantiago44/periodic-table)

  # Bill Divider
  The Bill Divider is a powerful iOS application designed to separrate your bills with other friends. You can create and view records,
  split bills with different configurations, select currencies, and more! You can view it [here](https://github.com/bernardosantiago44/bill-divider)
